# C++ Code

Before starting university I self taught myself in C++ and produced these small programs.

After learning the basics from tutorials I found a exercise sheet on a forum which I started to work through. These small programs and games are the result of those excersises.

Excersises found at: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/

Each .cpp file has a comment at the top to say which task it is.
